## Overview

This project introduces a modular, multi-theory agent-based simulation framework to model how belief systems, cultural signals, and ideological narratives influence collective economic behavior. It allows:

- Integration of behavioral theories like Social Identity Theory, Prospect Theory, and Narrative Economics
- Simulation of policy impacts across identity-based population clusters
- Detection of ideological tipping points and forecasting of macro-behavioral outcomes
